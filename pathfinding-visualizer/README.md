# Pathfinding Visualizer

Pathfinding Visualizer is an interactive web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) that allows users to visualize various pathfinding algorithms in action. It is a great tool for learning and understanding how algorithms like Dijkstra's, A\*, and others work in finding the shortest path between two points on a grid.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Create walls and obstacles to simulate real-world scenarios.
- **Algorithm Visualization**: Watch step-by-step how algorithms explore the grid and find the shortest path.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust grid size, speed of visualization, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
